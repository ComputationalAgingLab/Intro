# Principles

- Openness - all lab projects results should be available for third persons at any time.
    - Access to all community members (asking questions and response them by projects leaders)
    - Results should be published
    - Data & Code should be provided (for reproducibility) - Special tools should be used to satisfy this (docker)
- Regular meet-ups
    - global meet-ups - ~1 time per 2 months we gather to discuss current progress in projects
    - local meet-ups - ~1-2 times per 2 weeks collaborators of a project gather to discuss their progress
- Information exchange ASAP (as soon as possible)
    - Current problems should be discussed in messengers and resolved ASAP
    - Section for hypothesis should exist
- Non-profit
- Fully computational - we do not conduct wet experiments
    - however, we collaborate only with those who are ready to provide data for **open access**
